        <h3>Get Acquainted</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Reeds Creek Farms. The sheep idea started in 2014 while we were in the registered cattle business. There was a 20 acre piece of ground that was too rocky and grown up to run cows efficiently so we put goats on it. After several
          years of trying to keep the goats healthy and inside the fence we finally sold them and bought 20 sheep. 2 years later I decided it was time to increase the sheep production and get serious with it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Iâ€™ve always loved the challenges of breeding the best animals I can possibly produce. The number 1 goal here is to produce functional sheep that thrive on pasture with very little inputs. These sheep are expected to shed every year with no
          shearing, raise big lambs without the extra expense of feeding grain, and require very little deworming. We deworm the main flock once a year and any sheep that needs to be dewormed more than twice a year is culled. The flock is foot rot free
          and does not require hoof trimming.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We do rotational grazing to maximize the health of the sheep and keep a healthy pasture. We currently run about 150 ewes on 45 acres of pasture. Most of the ewes are commercial high percentage Dorper and White Dorper along with a small flock
          of registered White Dorpers. These are not bred for show but are designed to make a profit on pasture.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Feel free to contact us with questions or schedule a visit to see if we can fill your needs.</p>
